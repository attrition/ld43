**instructions**
* You are the blue side
* You have to defeat the red king
* To defeat the larger red side you'll have to sacrifice your
own men using the blue King's Drain ability. The friendly
unit will die but all the health will be transfered to the blue King,
* This should give him the health to survive the fight!

**extra details**

* each formation is made up of a series of 'figures'
* each figure in the formation attacks a figure in the defending side
* figures have health that is damaged by combat
* during combat figures will go one at a time, starting with an attacking figure
* if a figure applies more damage than required to kill another figure, this damage is applied to another figure as a form of 'overkill'
* this is how the king is able to wipe out large units on its own as the overkill damage is spread through the formation

good luck!
